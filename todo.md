 # TODOS
 - Clean out bad examples from dataset
 - ! Go through all pulsator / transit examples and doubly verify them
 -  - Maybe make a way to check them automatically, phase folding in code with the period used in the spreadsheets
 - Interface to see which examples are failing in training
 - Clean up Model Training file - move out models
 - implement async object querying
